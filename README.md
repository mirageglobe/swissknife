## 📅 TODO
- [ ] Refactor samurai script.
- [ ] Update system check utility.
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests.

## 🧪 Testing with Vagrant

You can spin up a dedicated test environment (Ubuntu Jammy) to test these scripts safely without affecting your host machine.

### Prerequisites
- VirtualBox
- Vagrant

### Why Vagrant?
Vagrant is preferred over Docker for this project because some scripts (like `jsk-swapfile.sh`) perform low-level system operations (kernel swap management, `/etc/fstab` modification) that are not natively supported or easily testable inside standard containers. A full VM ensures accurate verification of these system-level changes.

### Commands
- `make vm-up`: Start and provision the test VM. This will automatically install swissknife tools inside the VM.
- `make vm-ssh`: SSH into the test VM.
- `make vm-destroy`: Destroy the test VM.

Once inside the VM, you can test scripts like `jsk-swapfile.sh` which require Linux permissions.
